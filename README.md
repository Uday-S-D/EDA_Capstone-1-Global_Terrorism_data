GTD Definition of Terrorism and Inclusion Criteria
The GTD defines a terrorist attack as the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a nonstate actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or 
intimidation. In practice this means in order to consider an incident for inclusion in the GTD, all three of 
the following attributes must be present :

  The incident must be intentional â€“ the result of a conscious calculation on the part of a 
perpetrator. 
  
  The incident must entail some level of violence or immediate threat of violence -including 
property violence, as well as violence against people.
 
 The perpetrators of the incidents must be sub-national actors. The database does not include acts 
of state terrorism.

In addition, at least two of the following three criteria must be present for an incident to be included in 
the GTD:
  
  Criterion 1: The act must be aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious, or social goal. In 
terms of economic goals, the exclusive pursuit of profit does not satisfy this criterion. It must 
involve the pursuit of more profound, systemic economic change.
  
  Criterion 2: There must be evidence of an intention to coerce, intimidate, or convey some other 
message to a larger audience (or audiences) than the immediate victims. It is the act taken as a 
totality that is considered, irrespective if every individual involved in carrying out the act was aware 
of this intention. As long as any of the planners or decision-makers behind the attack intended to 
coerce, intimidate or publicize, the intentionality criterion is met.
  
  Criterion 3: The action must be outside the context of legitimate warfare activities. That is, the 
act must be outside the parameters permitted by international humanitarian law, insofar as it 
targets non-combatants
Each of these latter three criteria filters can be applied to the database on the GTD website and the full 
data file.
